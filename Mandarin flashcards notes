Make the initial dropdown menu have a choice for an entire book, listed before the name of each chapter.
-Also have one selection at the beginning for "all cards"

-in Study-page, I am splitting the array of characters and pinyin by commas. This is causing an issue when definitions within
the dictionary contain commas. Can the array be split into "|", then pulled apart?
    -I think it is the push in select-lesson that is creating an array with commas. I am then splitting by those built-in commas.
    -If I can split the array by an unusual character, it wouldnt interfere with my dictionary.

One child component should display, the other child component should allow for change.
Ie: one should have a button, the other a dynamic sentence affected by the button.

The parent will hold the flashcard object as its state.
this.state = {activeCard: {PH1: PH1, PH2: PH2}}

The parent will have a function that sets its state to a new active card array.

This function will be a prop within one of the children: <Child onChange={this.changeActiveCard} />. 
The child allows for the change (has a button, for instance).

The function will change the state of the parent. The sibling will have props for displaying the state. <Sibling card={this.state.activeCard}>
This array being held in the sibling's props will be displayed in sibling.
Ie: <h1> Your random card is: {this.props.card} </h1>

To sum-up: parent will display the child and sibling, and will hold the flashcards in its state.
Child will be a button that triggers a function in parent, and holds the dictionary info (various arrays). This function will setState to change the {card} array to a new array.
Sibling will display the contents of that new array. 


Problem 1:
The state of the parent cannot contain an object.
Solution:
Make the props contain the object (the dictionaries)

Currently working on: Random Flashcard.css. CSS not behaving how I expected.


DONE! The parent object now displays an updating array of characters.

Next: make the random element. One character must be chosen randomly from the current array.

DONE! The randomFlashcard element now reveals one random card from the character array.

Next: send the array of pinyin alongside the character array, and store it similarly.
The pinyin button should choose the currentCard number, and reveal that pinyin in response.
Send the pinyin array with the character array, then make the button reveal that pinyin array number. Not sure how
to make the changeLesson function send both of those arrays to the parent state.
